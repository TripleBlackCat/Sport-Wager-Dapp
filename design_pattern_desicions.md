# Design Pattern Decisions

## Emergency Stop
An Emergency Stop design pattern was implemented in the smart contract. This is extremely beneficial for pausing all contract functionality for when an error or vulnerability is detected. Furthermore, this contract stores Ether and can be withdrawn to orginal senders to prevent any hacks from occuring.

## Oracle
An oracle was inteded to be included and make calls to a sports API. This would still be desirable however was not implemented on time. Using an oracle means that one has to trust in the source of this informaton howver this can be eliviated by pulling from muliple APIs and ensuring that the reuslt is fair
